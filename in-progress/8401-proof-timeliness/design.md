## Executive Summary

The rollup contract will require that the pending chain be pruned to the proven chain if a proof for an epoch does not get verified on L1 in a fixed amount of time.

## Introduction

There is functionality in the rollup contract to prune the pending chain, but this is not currently used.

A strict proof timeliness requirement affords guarantees to users that their transactions will be included in the proven chain within a fixed amount of time.

This design focuses on how those timelines are defined and enforced by the rollup contract; it does not cover how nodes will handle the ensuing reorg with respect to their local state.

## Interface

Who are your users, and how do they interact with this? What is the top-level interface?

## Implementation

Delve into the specifics of the design. Include diagrams, code snippets, API descriptions, and database schema changes as necessary. Highlight any significant changes to the existing architecture or interfaces.

Discuss any alternative or rejected solutions.

### Proving phases

![Proving Phases](./proving-phases.png)

#### Proof claim phase

The beginning of each epoch is the "proof claim phase".

This phase has a duration of $C$ slots (e.g. 16 slots).

During this time, the proposer for a slot can submit a claim to be the prover for the previous epoch.

This can be a transaction separate from the submission of their proposed block.

Doing so grants monopoly rights to the rewards for submitting the proof of epoch `n-1`.

If no claim is submitted, the pending chain is pruned to the tip of the proven chain.

#### Proof production phase

If a claim is submitted during the proof claim phase, the next phase is the "proof production phase".

This phase has a duration of $P$ slots (e.g. 16 slots).

Failure to submit a proof results in the bond posted with the claim being slashed.

Further, the pending chain is pruned to the tip of the proven chain.

The wall time duration of $P$ slots must be greater than the time required to produce a proof.

For simplicity, $P + C <= E$: this means we will never be producing a proof for more than one epoch at a time.
