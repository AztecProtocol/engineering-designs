## Executive Summary

The rollup contract will require that the pending chain be pruned to the proven chain if a proof for an epoch does not get verified on L1 in a fixed amount of time.

## Introduction

There is functionality in the rollup contract to prune the pending chain, but this is not currently used.

A strict proof timeliness requirement affords guarantees to users that their transactions will be included in the proven chain within a fixed amount of time.

This design focuses on how those timelines are defined and enforced by the rollup contract; it does not cover how nodes will handle the ensuing reorg with respect to their local state.

## Proving phases

![Proving Phases](./proving-phases.png)

### Proof claim phase

The beginning of each epoch is the "proof claim phase".

This phase has a duration of $C$ slots (e.g. 13 slots. See notebook for modeling).

During this time, the proposer for a slot can submit a claim to be the prover for the previous epoch.

This can be a transaction separate from the submission of their proposed block.

Doing so grants monopoly rights to the rewards for submitting the proof of epoch `n-1`:
if there are block rewards in test token TST, they will be sent to the address that submitted the claim.

If no claim is submitted, the pending chain is pruned to the tip of the proven chain;
a caveat is if a proof for epoch `n-1` is submitted during the proof claim phase.

### Proof production

The proof for epoch `n-1` must land in epoch `n`.

Failure to submit a proof results in the bond posted with the claim being slashed if it exists.

Further, the pending chain is pruned to the tip of the proven chain.

Given that an epoch is $E$ slots, the wall time duration of $E-C$ slots must be greater than the time required to produce a proof.

## Rough Implementation

This is a rough, illustrative implementation of the proof timeliness requirement to guide intuition.  
For example, it is highly unlikely that the rollup contract will hold the bond.

The key "trick" is that we prune the pending chain as part of a proposer's block submission.

An observation is that in the current design, the committee does not change in the event that no proof claim is posted for the previous epoch.
