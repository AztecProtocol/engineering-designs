Go look in the `fee-model.ipynb` notebook for the actual simulation and fee model.

The setup is created with `uv`, so you should be good to run `uv sync` to get setup. Consider running `uv venv` to create a virtual environment first. You can add the kernel for the notebook by running `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=fee-model --display-name "Python (fee-model)"` and then selecting the kernel in the notebook settings.
