Go look in the `fee-model.py` marimo notebook for the actual simulation and fee model.

The setup is created with `uv`, so you should be good to run `uv sync` to get setup. Consider running `uv venv` to create a virtual environment first. Use `marimo` to open the notebook then; `marimo edit fee-model.py`.
