## Executive Summary

We currently publish transaction effects to L1. This means we execute the public portion of the transaction, accumulate all of its side effects, and publish those to the L1 contract.

In contrast, we're moving to a world where we simply publish the outputs of the private execution (performed by a user's PXE) and the public call requests.

Further, we are not requiring validators participating in the pending chain to execute transactions, and are merely required to verify the private proofs of transactions in a block that has been proposed.

## Introduction

### Epochs and committees

We have epochs, which are divided into $E$ slots, which are measured in $S$ seconds.

An epoch has a committee, which is responsible for proposing/validating blocks in the pending chain.

The committee is sampled from a broader validator set based on a seed that gets set when the first proposal in the _previous_ epoch is submitted.

The committee changes every epoch.

### Proposal process overview

TODO

### Committee Signature Scheme

For the following changes it is assumed that [Pleistarchus](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/7978) will be used.
This means that we will be using an optimistic approach for the sampling, proposer and signature validation.

### Changes to contracts

The contracts will be altered such that instead of receiving block `header`s and bodies with tx-effects (state diffs), we will now be receiving `proposal`s which include parts of what was previously in the `header` but not all of its components.

The proposal will be of the structure as follows, notable they DO NOT include an archive or references to the state:

```python
struct GasSettings:
  feePerDaGas: uint256
  feePerL2Gas: uint256


struct GlobalVariables:
  block_number: uint256
  slot_number: uint256
  timestamp: uint256
  coinbase: address
  fee_recipient: AztecAddress # discuss
  gas_settings: GasSettings


struct Attestations:
  signature: AggregateBLS
  missing: uint256 # Supports committee size of 256 members


struct ProposalHeader:
  num_tx: uint256
  txs_hash: bytes32
  kzg_hashes: bytes32
  in_hash: bytes32
  global_variables: GlobalVariables
  proposer_sig: ECDSA


struct CallContext:
  msg_sender: AztecAddress
  storage_contract_address: AztecAddress
  function_selector: bytes4
  is_delegate_call: bool
  is_static_call: bool


struct PublicCallRequest:
  target: AztecAddress
  call_context: CallContext
  args: DynArray[bytes32, ] #How we are dealing with the max number of args?


struct PrivateTxEffects:
  note_hashes: DynArray[bytes32, MAX_NOTE_HASHES_PER_TX]
  nullifiers: DynArray[bytes32, MAX_NULLIFIERS_PER_TX]
  l2_to_l1_messages: DynArray[bytes32, MAX_L2_TO_L1_MSGS_PER_TX]
  note_encrypted_logs_hashes: DynArray[bytes32, MAX_NOTE_ENCRYPTED_LOGS_PER_CALL]
  encrypted_logs_hashes: DynArray[bytes32, MAX_ENCRYPTED_LOGS_PER_CALL]
  unencrypted_logs_hashes: DynArray[bytes32, MAX_UNENCRYPTED_LOGS_PER_CALL]


# Need a better name for this one!
struct TxObject:
  max_fee: uint256
  private_tx_effects: PrivateTxEffects
  public_call_requests: DynArray[
    PublicCallRequest,
    MAX_PUBLIC_CALL_STACK_LENGTH_PER_TX
  ]


# Will be published in blobs. Capped by blobs
struct ProposalBody:
  txs: DynArray[TxObject, ]

```

As noted earlier, in [Proposal process overview](#proposal-process-overview), the proposal will eventually either be pruned or proven. To propose, the sequencer is publishing `ProposalHeader` and attestation as calldata and `ProposalBody` as blobs within a single L1 transaction.

> Most of the global variables could be directly populated by L1, but providing it makes it a lot clearer what the reason of failure is if such a one is encountered. Also the `inHash` can be populated by L1.

#### DA Oracle Changes

When the data is to be submitted as part of the same transaction as the block proposal to the L1 contract, we have two variations possible:

1. Remove the data availability oracle in its whole, and simply use the versioned KZG hashes directly
2. Save the versioned KZG hashes in the data availability oracle

Solution 1 is significantly cheaper as it don't update storage. Furthermore, by requiring that the versioned KZG hashes are part of the proposal provided, we can show the exact KZG hashes using just the transaction and the commitment to the proposal.

**Conclusion**: The data availability oracle dies.

#### Rollup Contract Changes

  block_number: uint256
  slot_number: uint256

  proposals[0] = ProposalLog(
    hash = GENESIS_PROPOSAL_HASH,
    slot = 0,
    archive = GENESIS_ARCHIVE
  )

def propose(proposal: ProposalHeader, attestations: Attestations):
  '''

  The signatures will be of the `ProposalHeader`
  '''
  if proposal.num_tx == 0:
    assert len(tx.blob_versioned_hashes) == 0
    assert proposal.kzg_hashes = empty(bytes32)
  else
    # Replaces DA oracle
    assert hash([h for h in tx.blob_versioned_hashes]) == proposal.kzg_hashes

  assert proposal.inHash == INBOX.consume(gv.block_number)

  self.proposals[gv.block_number] = ProposalLog(sha256(proposal, attestations), gv.slot_number)
  self.state.pending_tip = ChainTip(gv.block_number, gv.slot_number)

  self.proposals[block_number].archive = archive

  # TODO: Out hashes options
  # 1. List them and add individually
  # 2. Make another tree ðŸŒ²
```

- TODO:
  - What are we going to do with stuff like the outhashes? They depend on the execution, so we cannot really do it at the time of the proposal if that is. So we would practically need it to happen with the entire epoch at this point. Might just be another tree to make it cheaper. It gets kinda funky with finding the block number because it depends.

### Changes to circuits

#### Rollup circuits

Circuit changes for the rollup circuits have a few points of interest:
- [The transaction validity conditions](#transaction-validation)
- The introduction of `txs_hash`
- Posting the objects instead of effects as the body

We will ignore the validity conditions here since that is described later.

For the `txs_hash` the idea is relatively simple - build a merkle root (SHA256) of the `tx_hash` for every transaction in the proposal.
As briefly mentioned earlier, this is to more easily support forced inclusion, and prove that a tx was included in a specific block.
The practical implementation would be very much like the `out_hash` or `txs_effects_hash`.

For the objects, we can keep the private state diff as is, but need to have the private kernel insert the enqueued public calls as well. 
No state changes from the AVM should make their way into this, so the public kernel should be altered to not push things around. 

### Changes to the node

Since the L1 will no longer know about the complete state-diffs, the node will be unable to simple download these and apply them. This means that the node will instead get a hold of the `ProposalHeader` and `ProposalBody` from L1. It could then apply these proposals on top of its current state to progress. Essentially to sync all of the history on top of the genesis state by re-execution. This model is very similar to what is done in Ethereum or really most blockchains. Consider looking at https://forum.aztec.network/t/collaborative-based-rollups/5227 for a more thorough walkthrough.

When applying the history through re-execution, the node will need to also use the same version of the AVM (Aztec Virtual Machine) as was used when the proof was originally submitted to the rollup contract, practically meaning that the node will need multiple versions and how to distinguish between "when" they were used. Keeping track of the versions and when they were used is handled by the Gerousia and Apella design, but the actual versions need to stored separately as they are only referred through version id and verification keys on the rollup.

Note, that since every epoch is to be proven, there will be a state root `archive` after each of those that a user can use as a "root of trust" and check against. This is also useful when validating snapshots received.

The node will have its own view of the current `archive` and state based on the proposals that it have applied itself.

> Remember, that one can always get someone else to perform the job of re-executing (look at infura/alchemy and Ethereum), but that comes with its own concerns.

#### Forks (re-orgs)

Separately to this change with re-execution, the node will need to handle forking and re-orgs as well. This is not really specific to this proposal, but have not really been discussed for the point of view of the node. When we above pointed to the current `archive` based on the proposal it have applied, we say so as there could potentially be multiple proposals which have been published (for the same block number / at the same height).

Since we push the L1 to figure out what is the real, the node will need to take the `ProposalLog` from the contract into account when it is applying the state changes.
To have the view of the proven chain, the node must simple apply all of the `ProposalLog`'s that are stored in the `proposals` and have a block number smaller than or equal to the `proven_tip`.
Everything beyond the `proven_tip` is still "up for discussion".
This means that we need to support the ability to "revert" full blocks, since they might have been applied at the start of an epoch, but you then later figure out that it was no good, e.g., not proven in time,
In this case, you want to go back to the proven chain, throwing the current pending chain away, and then start new pending proposals.

The PXE also need to have an idea around if things have been forked out, since we don't want it to believe that it have plenty of notes, but only figure out when it needs to spend those that it don't.
One way to deal with this, could be that the PXE will check that its "new" notes and nullifiers are indeed in the `archive` whenever a proof lands on L1.

### Prover interactions

### Private kernel verification

Validators need to verify the private kernels, and should only attest to proposals where all are valid.

### Transaction validation

A transaction is "valid" if and only if it can be included in a block (and subsequently an epoch), and the proof of that epoch can be verified on L1.

Nodes need to "validate" transactions: i.e. check if a transaction is valid.

It _must_ be possible to determine if a transaction is valid without executing it.

Therefore, transactions _must_ be valid iff it has a private kernel proof that successfully verifies.

#### Changes needed

There are many cases today where a transaction is invalid, and cannot be included in a block, e.g.:

- global variable mismatches (chainId, version, etc.)
- transactions reverting in public setup
- the transaction was not included before its "max block"
- duplicate nullifiers
- invalid sibling paths
- etc.

The protocol must gracefully handle these cases, and instead of having the transaction be invalid, it should allow the transaction to be included, but with a "failed" status.

In the event of a "failed" transaction, the transaction will appear in the block, but with no side effects, apart from its transaction nullifier.

Further, the transaction's fee will be set to zero.

**Invalid sibling paths**:
As the sequencer is the one providing membership paths for the base rollup, it must not be possible for him to deliberately provide bad paths, thereby making the tx "invalid" and make it have no effect.
To address this, we can add another check to each of our membership or non memberships, to ensure that the paths provided were not utter nonsense.
Remember that failure to prove inclusion is not equal non-inclusion.
This check is fairly simple, if it is a membership check where an index was provided, and it fails, the sequencer must show what the "real" value was, and that it differs.
If it is a membership without a provided index, and it fails, a non-membership must be made.
If it is a non-membership we must prove that it was in there.
Essentially the sequencer is to do an `xor` operation, with membership and non-membership - one of them must be valid if he is not lying.

### Proving phases

<!-- Editors: you can copy/paste the png from the repository into excalidraw to make edits. -->

![Proving Phases](./proving-phases.png)

#### Proof claim phase

The beginning of each epoch is the "proof claim phase".

This phase has a duration of $C$ slots (e.g. 16 slots).

During this time, the proposer for a slot can submit a claim to be the prover for the previous epoch.

This can be a transaction separate from the submission of their proposed block.

Doing so grants monopoly rights to the rewards for submitting the proof of epoch `n-1`.

If no claim is submitted, the pending chain is pruned to the tip of the proven chain.

#### Proof production phase

If a claim is submitted during the proof claim phase, the next phase is the "proof production phase".

This phase has a duration of $P$ slots (e.g. 16 slots).

Failure to submit a proof results in the bond posted with the claim being slashed.

Further, the pending chain is pruned to the tip of the proven chain.

The wall time duration of $P$ slots must be greater than the time required to produce a proof.

For simplicity, $P + C <= E$: this means we will never be producing a proof for more than one epoch at a time.
