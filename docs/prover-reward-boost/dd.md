## Executive Summary

To incentivize consistent proving, we "boost" the share of rewards going to consistent provers based on their activity.

Basic requirement: Provers that consistently prove blocks should be rewarded more than provers that sporadically prove blocks.

## Timeline

- Update the contracts: 1-2 days
- @aminsammara and @joeandrews chooses params: ðŸ¤·

Total: 2 days + ðŸ¤·

## Introduction

We want people to prove consistently.
This work pay people proving consistently a bigger share of rewards.

Assumes that there will be more than 1 prover.
Otherwise the share don't matter.

## Interface

No user will interact directly with this, it is merely an accounting update behind the scenes.

## Implementation

Please consult the interactive `marimo` notebook for this, that is probably much simpler. Same text as here is also in there.

Currently a prover have `1` share of the reward.
To support boosting, we alter this such that a prover will instead have that their number of shares depends on their prior actions.

To do so, we will first introduce an "activity score" and then a method to derive the number of shares from that it.

Every `prover` will have some value `x` that is stored for them specifically reflecting their recent activity.
The value is computed fairly simply.
Every time an epoch passes, the activity score goes down by 1.
Every block the prover produces increases their value with 2.
The value is bounded to be between `0` and `upper`.

We use `upper` to limit the score in order to constrain how long a boost is maintained after the actor stops proving.

Beware that this structure means that the score WILL go down, if there is nothing to prove.
This is acknowledged, since supporting that makes the accounting much simpler and cheaper, as we only need to store a score and a time of that score to be able to derive the current score.

The score and timestamp is then updated at proof submission.

By then feeding this activity value as $x$ into the following formula, we compute their share.

$$
y(x) = \begin{cases}
	\max(k - a(x - h)^2, m), & \text{if } x \leq h \\
	k, & \text{if } x > h
\end{cases}
$$

In here, $k$ acts as the "max" boost that can be hit, and $h$ the score at which this is hit. The value $m$ is the default multiplier.

Note, that setting $h$ to be equal the `upper` limit that we supplied earlier is a way to have instant decay. As $h$ becomes equal to `upper` note that we cannot hit the $x > h$ case anymore.

---

The practical implementation will update the `SubEpochRewards` struct, `EpochProofLib::handleRewardsAndFees` and `RewardLib::claimProverRewards`.

```solidity
// Old
struct SubEpochRewards {
  uint256 summedCount;
  mapping(address prover => bool proofSubmitted) hasSubmitted;
}

// New
struct SubEpochRewards {
  uint256 summedShares;
  mapping(address prover => uint256 shares) proverShares;
}
```

`EpochProofLib::handleRewardsAndFees`:
Instead of storing `bool` with `hasSubmitted` we store the `proverShares`, and increase the `summedShares` instead `summedCount`.

`RewardLib::claimProverRewards`:
Hence we don't have `hasSubmitted` anymore, we will simply alter the accumulation as:

```solidity
SubEpochRewards storage es = e.subEpoch[e.longestProvenLength];
accumulatedRewards += (es.proverShares[msg.sender] * e.rewards / es.summedShares);
```
