## Key words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

## Background

Provide a high-level background for the project. Add links to any relevant documents rather than duplicating information.

Explain what the status quo is and why it is inadequate.

## Desired User Flow(s)

Provide a high-level overview of the desired user flow.

There may be multiple user flows, and each flow should be in its own section.

Place the most important user flows first.

For example, if the project is about ensuring that upgrading to a new version of the rollup is "easy", focus on **who** you most want it to be easy for, and **what experience** you want them to have.

Each flow should discuss why you believe the user demands (or will tolerate) this experience.

### (Example) Easy Upgrades for End Users

When there is a new canonical version of the rollup, end users (i.e. wallets) want...

We know this because...

### (Example) Easy Upgrades for Validators

When there is a new canonical version of the rollup, validator operators want...

We know this because...

## Requirements

Describe all the requirements you know of for the project which are relevant given the delivery deadline.

For example, if we were speccing an upgrade mechanism for a "regular database", we might have the following requirements:

### Functional Requirements

#### (Example) Data Migration Utility

- What: The system MUST include a utility that automatically migrates legacy schemas and data to the new database format.
- Why: To ensure a seamless transition with minimal manual intervention, preventing data loss or inconsistencies during the upgrade.
- Where: Derived from stakeholder interviews and an analysis of the current systemâ€™s limitations.

#### (Example) Backup and Rollback Mechanism

- What: The system MUST create a complete backup of the existing database and provide a rollback option in case of upgrade failures.
- Why: To safeguard against potential data corruption or upgrade errors, ensuring business continuity.
- Where: Based on IT risk assessments and business continuity planning guidelines.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Security Compliance

- What: The upgrade process MUST enforce encryption and strict access control measures to protect data in transit and at rest.
- Why: To protect sensitive information against unauthorized access and to comply with data protection regulations.
- Where: Sourced from regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and security audits.

#### Maintainability

- What: Upgrade scripts and procedures SHOULD be modular and well-documented to facilitate future maintenance and troubleshooting.
- Why: To reduce long-term maintenance costs and ensure the system can be easily updated or modified.
- Where: Informed by best practices in IT service management and lessons learned from previous upgrade projects.

### Performance Requirements

#### (Example) Upgrade Speed

- What: The migration process MUST complete within a 4-hour maintenance window.
- Why: To minimize system downtime and avoid disruption to business operations during the upgrade.
- Where: Based on service level agreements (SLAs) and operational constraints set by the IT department.

#### (Example) Post-Upgrade Query Performance

- What: Average query response times MUST NOT exceed 200 milliseconds under normal load conditions.
- Why: To ensure that system performance meets user expectations and maintains efficient operations.
- Where: Derived from performance benchmarks established during testing and requirements from the performance engineering team.
- NOTE: Within the next 12 months, we will want this to be 100 milliseconds.
